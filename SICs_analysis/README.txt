Stool derived in vitro communities analysis from JM master thesis.
It includes the following R code files:
  original_dada2.Rmd: Fecal samples used for the SICs sequenced by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Processing of the sequencing data using the DADA2 pipeline.
  stability_dada2.Rmd: Stool-derived in vitro communities sequenced by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Processing of the sequencing data using the DADA2 pipeline.
  perturbations_dada2.Rmd: Stool-derived in vitro communities perturbed with inulin, starch or MIX sequenced by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Processing of the sequencing data using the DADA2 pipeline.
  stability_analysis.Rmd: Analysis of the taxonomic composition of the SICs in comparison with the original fecal samples
  perturbations_analysis.Rmd: Analysis of the taxonomic composition of the perturbed SICs in comparison with the stable SICs
