# Pastobiome: 
Pastobiome project: the gut microbiota of agropastoralist and pastoralist children from Adadle region in the Somali Regional State of Ethiopia.

The population living in the Adadle region are consuming animal milk, especially camel milk, as well as starch-rich food such as wheat, maize, rice, sorghum and potato. Very little amount of meat, fish, vegetables and fruits are consummed by the children living in the region (Osman et al., 2020).

In recent years, differences in the gut microbiota composition between populations from industrialized countries and communities living a more traditional liestyle, such as hunter-gatherers and agropastoralism, were shown. Notably, higher relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, Spirochaetaceae and Succinivibrionaceae were observed in traditional communities while urban industrial population had higher level of Bacteroidaceae and Akkermensiaceae.

In the Pastobiome project, we aim at describing the gut microbiota composition and functional profile of children from traditional agropastoral and pastoral communities with this very specific diet. 
Additionally, we are investigating the gut miccrobiota changes in the context of undernutrition in this community.

## JOHI study:
Our first study looked at the microbiome composition of 54 fecal samples using 16S rRNA gene amplcion sequencing. Additionally, the microbiota composition was confirmed and the functional profile assessed using 15 samples sent for shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
